# Abstract

The Digital Freedom Alliance should start organize a digital footprint starting with a simple "linktr.ee"
style website that links to the DFA policy thesis, action steps, and community conversation. In it's
simplest form, it should be a one-stop-shop for all information, and should be linked to appropriate
domains and social media accounts.

# Motivation

This simple linked website can list various assets the organization holds to direct members and interested
individuals. Many digital organizations have various applications spread across multiple domains. Already,
discussion in the DFA discord prompted various communication tools and links to material that should be
considered "standard reading" for interested participants. Along with this, various social media and
publications will likely be spread across multiple domains, which may include podcasts, youtube accounts,
and other media.

A simple to use, mobile friendly website should be the go-to solution for the DFA. To begin, offical
leadership should curate this list as best as possible, but allow organic growth for members to experiment
with various solutions until a "best-solution" is found.

# Key Metrics

### Daily Hits

- Measure daily hits for the website to measure growth of it's usage.

### Click Through Rates

- Measure click-through rates for various links highlighted on the website.

### Donations

- Measure donation flow through the website. It is assumed donations will be directly linked to the website.

# Specification

Possible options and their considerations for the initial website include:

### Linktr.ee

- Simple to set up, and low cost.
- Integrates a payment solution for future donations.
- Easy to manipulate and adjust links, but nothing else.
- Gives an organized direct-to-action user experience.
- Doesn't include a way for open-source collaboration on the site itself.

### Github Pages

- Simple to use markdown style pages. Low cost.
- Doesn't have a payment solution integrated for donations.
- Open source, so new updates can be decentralized to other members.

### JS.wiki

- Customizable wiki deployable on cloud servers.
- Uses Digital Ocean for cloud provisioning.
- Good for organizing long form discussion.

# Considerations

### Twitter

A viable option could be to include twitter as the one-stop shop for news and information relating to the DFA. Some possible issues
include:

- Requires some curation and a manager of the account, discouraging open-source collaboration of the content.

### Fully Featured Website

Focusing on a fully featured website is a possible option. Directing some energy to a professional long form
site that users can explore and view news and related readings could be a viable option. Some issues with this are:

- Longer time to market.
- Requires engineering expertise and discourages open-source updating.
